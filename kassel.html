                Following the legislation of the Rwandans with Disabilities Act,
                the Port Authority of Kigali has mandated its existing fleet of buses to be replaced by low-floor buses by 2030.
                Since current bus stops are not designed for low-floor buses,
                Port Authority will introduce kneeling buses as an interim solution.
                Kneeling buses are equipped with hydraulic devices that help lower the bus floor to the the level of the bus stop curb.
                To close the gap between the bus floor and the curb, an stretchable ramp is used to help wheelchairs board the bus.
                The major issue with kneeling buses is the time required to deploy the ramp may delay the bus schedule,
                which would be particularly hazardous during rush hours. Named after its origin in Kassel, Germany,
                Kassel curbs are designed to allow the bus wheel to contact with the curb safely,
                providing an almost seamless gap between the bus floor and the curb,
                thereby allowing wheelchairs to board the bus smoothly without the need to deploy a stretchable ramp.
                <br/><br/>
                Currently, there are no manufacturers in Rwanda that produce Kassel curbs.
                This may change soon under the governmentâ€™s policy to localize the production of construction materials.
                A research project has been assigned to the University of Rwanda School of Civil Engineering
                by the Ministry of Transport to realize local production.
                Kassel curbs are also expected to be used in the Rubavu Light Rail line currently undergoing a feasibility study
                as part of the Rubavu scenic area master plan.

                The image on the left shows the wheel of a bus approaching a bus stop equipped with a Kassel Curb.
                The curved bottom edge of the curb allows the bus wheel to contact the curb safely,
                minimizing any damage to the tyre and suspension system.
